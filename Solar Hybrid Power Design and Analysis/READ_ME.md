The overarching purpose of this project was to analyze the performance of a concentrating
photovoltaic (PV) system that also captures waste heat from the PV cell to produce power, a
so-called hybrid power system in 6 steps. This system was proposed for a spacecraft designed to
transport astronauts from the earth to the moon and back.
