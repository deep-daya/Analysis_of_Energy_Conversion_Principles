Designed a program to calculate the incident direct radiation per square meter of a solar collector for a specified time, latitude, day of year, solar azimuth angle while determining it's efficiency. Implemented the program to determine the specifications of a design target while including real-world factors such as shading, dust and cloud cover. Calculated the reduction in CO2 emissions from a natural gas plant if the collector was used.
