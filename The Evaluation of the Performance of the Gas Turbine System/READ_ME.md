Analyzed the hybrid solar fossil-fuel gas turbine system, to construct a computer simulation of the performance of the system. Developed a program that found the value of the molar air-to-fuel ratio α that would result in a product temperature Tp for specified reactant temperature Tr. Designed a program to compute the exit condition from the compressor and the work required per kilogram of air using a constant cˆ p and cˆ v analysis. Derived relations for the mole fraction of each exhaust gas species as a function of molar air to fuel ratio α. Used this to design a program to compute cˆ p, prod for the product gas mixture as the mole-fraction weighted average of the cˆ p values for the individual species. Combined the steps to complete the simulation of the cycle and analyze its overall performance. Altered Qs input and gamma to see the change in efficiency, power input, and heat input.
